# MusicMemory_NIH
Based on Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Dataset provided by NIH, We Investigate Relationship
Between Memory of Musicians and Non-musicians.

# How to Run
To use this MATLAB source code, please make sure to put all .csv files of NIH ABCD dataset into the folder "NIHTB", and then run the files in order.
First_ReadFiles.m, Second_ScoresTests.m, Third_ReadMusixData.m, Fourth_CorrelationPracticeTime.m

# Explanation
Two memort tasks are utilized for both musicians and non-musicians.
First task: Picture Sequence Memory Test (PSMT)
Second Test: List Sorting Working Memory Test (LSWMT)

Results indicated that due to the p-value less than 0.05, memory score of musicians and non'musicians differ significantly.
But the training hours per week doesn't correlate with memory score of musicians. Therefore, musicians who practice more don't
necessarily have better memory scores.
